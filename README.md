# Object Detection using YOLOv8 and Computer Vision

This project implements real-time human detection using **YOLOv8** and enhances analysis with classic computer vision techniques like **GMM**, **PCA**, **HOG**, and **Background Subtraction**.

## ðŸ›  Techniques Used
- **YOLOv8**: Primary human detection using a pretrained model.
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**: Background modeling and motion detection.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**: Shape-based human detection.
- **Time Series PCA**: Tracks movement patterns over time.
- **Background Subtraction (MOG2)**: Foreground isolation.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Visual highlight of detected humans.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases
- CCTV surveillance
- Smart traffic systems
- Crowd monitoring
- Industrial safety
